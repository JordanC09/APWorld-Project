          Simon Bolivar, known as “El Libertador”, was a transformative figure in Latin America’s history for fighting for independence. This would go on to inspire the continent for many generations to come.  The story of Simon Bolivar begins on July 24th, 1783, in Venezuela, Caracas. Simon Bolivar was born into a wealthy family, but soon, both his parents died of tuberculosis, and he was orphaned at a young age. British historian John Lynch described his life as “at once privileged and deprived.”

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Simon Bolivar’s early life was marked by defiance and misfortune. At a young age, Bolivar neglected his studies and was notoriously unruly. Bolivar served under the tutelage of Miguel Jose Sanz.  However, he was then enrolled in primary school under the instruction of Simon Rodriguez. After fleeing his uncle’s custody in 1795, he attempted to flee to his older sister’s custody which proved to no avail. In the end, he sought to return to Rodriguez’s home, which was where his education truly began to flourish. Under Rodriguez’s tutelage, Bolivar was able to learn the basic ideas of Rousseau, Voltaire, Locke, and even other Enlightenment philosophers. However, in 1797. Rodriguez would be exiled due to his connections to pro-independence Gual and Spain conspiracy, a pro-independence movement. As a result, Bolivar enrolled in the honorary militia force. Simon would be promoted to an officer and move to Madrid under his uncle Carlos’s decision. He would then voyage to Spain on a Spanish warship, De Ildefonso, and would be educated in classics, literature, and social studies. Bolivar would return back to Venezuela with a newfound wife. But shortly, his wife would die of yellow fever. Devastated, he traveled back to Europe to console his father-in-law. While doing so, he also went to Paris where he met many influential figures of the independence movements occurring across the globe. By April 1805, Bolivar, inspired by his past experiences and education, vowed to bring an end to the Spanish rule of the Americas.

        <h2>Venezuelean Independence</h2>
        <p>
          At the time, Venezuela suffered from several social, political, and economic issues that all contributed significantly to the spark of a revolution in Latin America. The class system meant that American-born Spaniards had fewer rights than those born on the mainland. Before and while Bolivar was growing Venezuela had revolution and revolution to try and overthrow their oppressors however each and every time they were crushed. The ideas of enlightenment and recent revolutions influenced many of these people to rise up and fight unsuccessfully. During this time the Napoleonic wars were happening meaning that the Spanish were taken over by France and for a short period of time Venezuela was independent However this was not to last, as the Spanish started to defeat Napoleon in Europe and Spanish troops were being sent to Venezuela. Taking advantage of this situation, Bolivar would successfully liberate Venezuela. But this victory would be short-lived as the Republic of Venezuela was very weak and Bolivar would be besieged and kicked out. Shortly after, Bolivar arrived in Jamaica and wrote the Jamaica letter, which discussed his vision of a free Latin America,  after reflecting on his failed independence movement. He would soon receive support from Haiti, and return to Venezuela again rallying republican support. He would then establish a stable republican base in Angostura. He would soon be elected as President by the Congress of Angostura.

        <p>
          After Bolivar won multiple battles against the Spanish, Bolivar advocated for a state called Gran Colombia made up of lands of the countries that he liberated. Gran Colombia was a state of its own in which it constrained areas that Bolivar liberated/planned on liberating, it had a congress and a constitution and it acted as a confederation. Simon wanted Gran Colombia to be a federation of Latin America and a constitutional government of ideas of freedom and rights for all. However, most of Gran Colombia was still under Spanish control so Bolivar quickly got to work. Bolivar would continue to recruit soldiers and people to his cause in order to push back the Spanish.

          Bolívar was an adaptive strategist, using guerrilla tactics and innovative military strategies to lead his troops through the challenging Andes Mountains, overcoming both natural and colonial forces. His famous "Admirable Campaign" and the crossing of the Andes into New Granada (modern Colombia) exemplify his bold and high-risk maneuvers, which helped secure significant victories. Bolivar was inspired by Enlightenment thinkers he was previously educated such as Rousseau and Montesquieu. However, Gran Colombia would soon collapse as regional governors and citizens began questioning his approach to governance. Bolivar would attempt to reestablish his control but failed, only deepening divides. Bolivar eventually resigned under this pressure and the federation would soon break into pieces, each region independently establishing itself as a separate nation.

        <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
        <p>Bolivar would eventually share his parent's unfortunate fate and die of tuberculosis at the age of 47 in poverty and exile. His legacy, however, will continue to live on in Latin-Independence independence. Although his dream of a united Latin America failed, he is widely celebrated today and remains a symbol of independence and influences the region’s politics and identity.  Bolivar's political philosophy, which combined with the Enlightenment, continues to inspire Latin American leaders to this day.
